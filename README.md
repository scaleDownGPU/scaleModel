# scaleModel

The continuously increasing GPU system scale and compute capabilities, i.e., increasing number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs), caches, on-chip and off-chip memory bandwidth, pose a major challenge for performance evaluation methodologies. Architectural simulation is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and because of simulator and/or simulation host infrastructure limitations, it might not even be possible to simulate large-scale systems. Scale-model simulation is a recently proposed performance prediction methodology to predict large- scale system performance based on (much smaller) scale models. Prior work in scale-model simulation for general-purpose multi- core CPUs and specialized graph analytics accelerators, unfortu- nately, cannot be readily applied to GPUs because different GPU applications exhibit vastly different scaling behavior with system size, thereby breaking the one-size-fits-all regression models deployed in prior work. This paper proposes a GPU scale-model simulation method- ology that leverages performance measurements of two scale models alongside a miss rate curve to predict GPU target system performance. A key asset of GPU scale-model simulation is that it does not require access to a simulation model of the target system, unlike prior work in simulation acceleration.
